        New York City (NYC), often called the City of New York or simply New
        York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. With an
        estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over about 302.6
        square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated
        major city in the United States.[10] Located at the southern tip of the
        U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York
        metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban
        landmass.[11] With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan
        statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined
        statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New
        York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media
        capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[12]
        entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art,
        fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[13]
        New York is an important center for international diplomacy.
        <br /><br />
        Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is
        composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New
        York.[16] The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and
        Staten Island—were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[17] The city
        and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal
        immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in
        New York,[18] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the
        world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside
        the United States,[19] the largest foreign-born population of any city
        in the world as of 2016.[20][21] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan
        area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0
        trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it
        would have the 8th largest economy in the world. New York is home to the
        highest number of billionaires of any city in the world. <br /><br />
        New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists
        from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named
        New Amsterdam in 1626.[22] The city and its surroundings came under
        English control in 1664[22] and were renamed New York after King Charles
        II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[23]
        New York was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[24]
        and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.[25] The Statue of Liberty
        greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the
        late 19th and early 20th centuries[26] and is a symbol of the U.S. and
        its ideals of liberty and peace.[27] In the 21st century, New York has
        emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship[28] and
        environmental sustainability,[29][30] and as a symbol of freedom and
        cultural diversity.[31] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in
        the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide,
        citing its cultural diversity. <br /><br />
        Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including
        three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013.[33] A
        record 62.8 million tourists visited New York City in 2017. Times Square
        is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[34]
        one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[35][36] and a major
        center of the world's entertainment industry.[37] Many of the city's
        landmarks, skyscrapers,[38] and parks are known around the world.
        Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the
        world.[39][40] New York is home to the largest ethnic Chinese population
        outside of Asia,[41][42] with multiple distinct Chinatowns across the
        city. Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname
        The City that Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest
        single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations.
        The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia
        University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City
        University of New York system, which is the largest urban public
        university system in the United States.[43] Manhattan is home to the
        world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization,
        namely the New York Stock Exchange, located on Wall Street in the
        Financial District of Lower Manhattan, and NASDAQ, headquartered in
        Midtown Manhattan.
